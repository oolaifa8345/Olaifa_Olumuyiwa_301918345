## Case study

My case study is Bank / Fintech Platform. I designed the database for customers reviewing account activity, operations staff monitoring payment outcomes and students practicing relational design and transaction control, with separate tables named customer, account and payment. It supports these operations: create synthetic customer accounts and record payments; join Payment to Account and Customer to retrieve customer payment history; filter payments by account, status, and initiation date; join Payment to Account, filter settled payments by date, and aggregate counts and amounts by account and currency; separate benchmark plan: load 50000 synthetic payments, compare the initiated_at date-range filter before and after a B-tree index, and compare returned row counts and execution plans.

## Portfolio 1: Database Design and Modelling

I organised the relational design into 3 tables. Primary keys identify records, foreign keys preserve the links, and checks enforce the stated business rules. When reference is not null, it must be unique within its account. The normalisation examples show the sample data at 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. All 25 deliberately invalid inserts were rejected without changing the valid sample rows.

## Portfolio 2: Query Processing and Optimisation

I ran three SQL queries against the sample records. The join returned 1 rows and included ACCT-2001 with customer1@example.test. For the index comparison, I used 50,000 separate performance rows. The median lookup time changed from 2.231 ms to 0.234 ms. Both phases returned the same records. The measured plan used the new index. These timings apply to this lookup and environment.

## Portfolio 3: Transactions and Concurrency

I used a temporary counter on account to test COMMIT, ROLLBACK and READ COMMITTED isolation. The uncommitted update remained hidden from the other session, and ROLLBACK restored the earlier committed value. Without locking, two increments left the counter at 2. With SELECT FOR UPDATE, Session B waited for Session A and the final value was 3. The helper is confined to this exercise; the case's original business fields stay unchanged.

## Portfolio 4: NoSQL and Advanced Data Models

I used payment_events for the case's event documents. MongoDB inserted 2 sample events and returned the expected results for 4 queries. Validation rejected an invalid date type and a duplicate event ID. Embedded snapshots keep related details with an event, while the details field can differ by event type. These are fictional events; PostgreSQL continues to enforce its relational rules.

## Portfolio 5: Distributed and Cloud Database Exercise

I proposed three MongoDB replica members across separate failure zones. The discussion covers primary elections, majority acknowledgement, secondary lag and sharding trade-offs for payment_events. Replication supports availability, while backups address recovery. PostgreSQL needs its own availability plan. This is the permitted discussion option; no live replica set or failover test was deployed.

## Individual reflection

I kept customer, account, payment in separate tables so their details could be maintained without repeating them in every related record. When reference is not null, it must be unique within its account. The constraint tests check this alongside the required values and record links. One issue illustrated by the two-session exercise is that both sessions can read the same value before either update is committed. Locking the row before reading preserves both increments. The index comparison also shows why I need to check the execution plan as well as the final answer: the same result can require different amounts of database work.

## AI-use declaration

I used GitHub Copilot and the portfolio generator to help prepare the database model, scripts and explanations. The generator ran the PostgreSQL and MongoDB exercises, checked their outputs and captured the result images.  I remain responsible for checking and explaining the submitted work.
